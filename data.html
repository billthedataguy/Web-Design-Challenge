        <ul>
            <li>The table must be a Bootstrap table component. Refer to the Bootstrap documentation for how to use responsive tables.</li>
            <li>The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML or by converting it to HTML.</li>
            <li>Try using a tool that you already know: Pandas. Pandas has a method, appropriately called to_html, that allows you to generate an HTML table from a Pandas DataFrame.</li>
            <li>To learn more, review the documentation.</li>
            <li>The grid must be two visualizations across medium and large screens, and it must be one visualization across on extra-small or small screens.</li>
        </ul>
